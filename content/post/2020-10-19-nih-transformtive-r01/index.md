We were awarded the [NIH Directors' Transformative Research Award](https://commonfund.nih.gov/TRA/recipients) to develop new approaches to develop new approaches to measure biochemical activities at cellular resolution.

This award stems from the hard work of Mandy Richer, who worked out the approach to measure activities of DNA repair enzymes in cells. We are now scaling the method to measure other types of enzymes as well as look at other approaches for understanding enzymatic activity at single-cell resolution.
