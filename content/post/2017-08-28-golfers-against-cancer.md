We would like to thank the [Golfers Against Cancer](http://www.denvergolfersagainstcancer.org/projects.htm) for supporting our work on a new method to measure intrinsic DNA repair capacity in single cells. We will apply the method to understand the intrinsic heterogeneity of DNA repair activity among tumor cells and how this heterogeneity contributes to resistance to cancer therapies.
