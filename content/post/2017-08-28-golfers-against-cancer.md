We would like to thank the [Golfers Against Cancer](http://www.denvergolfersagainstcancer.org/projects.htm) for supporting our work on a new method to measure cell-to-cell variability of DNA repair capacity in single cells. We will apply the method to understand how heterogeneity of DNA repair activity among tumor cells contributes to resistance to cancer therapies.
