We are hiring [postdoctoral research associates](https://cu.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobdetail.ftl?job=19349&lang=en) and [professional research assistants](https://cu.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobdetail.ftl?job=19600&lang=en) to support our work in single-cell technology development.

Wed lab recently developed two new single-cell approaches to [measure biochemical activities in single cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32286626/) and to [track DNA conjugates through tissues](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.19.219527v1). We now plan to deploy these methods broadly and also develop companion technologies. A Professional Research Assistant will focus on their development and application and will focus on the following projects:

- Developing of new single-cell biochemical methods to enable CRISPR and small molecule inhibitor screens
- Integrating single cell biochemistry data with single cell RNA-seq
- Optimizing molecular tracking devices for studying ligand dissemination in tissue
- Applying these tools to spatial approaches to understand biochemical acitivites and ligand dissemination in situ.

Candidates will also work closely with the [RNA Bioscience Initiative](https://rockyrna.org) to develop new analysis strategies for single cell biochemistry and molecular tracking data.
