**Greetings.** Welcome to the `Hesselberth lab
<http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Faculty/PrimaryFaculty/Pages/Hesselberth.aspx>`_
in the `Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics department
<http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Pages/Home.aspx>`_
at the `University of Colorado School of Medicine
<http://www.ucdenver.edu/anschutz/Pages/landing.aspx>`_. We develop
molecular methods to study DNA, RNA and proteins, and apply them to study
specific biological problems. We also collaborate extensively with others
to apply these methods as broadly as possible.

:fa:`fa-flask fa-3x fa-border pull-left` **DNA modification and
mutation**. We are developing genome-scale methods for studying how DNA
modifications lead to mutation. Our new `Exicision-seq method
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015380>`_ enables high resolution
mapping of modified nucleobases throughout the genome. These methods
enable dissection of the mutational process, and may yield insights into
how hot spots of mutation form in the human genome. We are currently using
Excision-seq to study uracilcation of HIV genomes during infection, and
DNA demethylation by 5-methyl cytosine oxidation. We are also extending
the method to characterize other types of DNA damage genomes, including
sugar and phosphate modifications.

:fa:`fa-flask fa-3x fa-border pull-left` **RNA healing and decay**. We
previously developed `methods
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075163>`_ to identify RNAs with
"dirty" ends that are generated by programmed or unintentional RNA
cleavage. We discovered that repair of these "dirty" ends governs the fate
of RNA fragments, poising them for further processing or decay. Moreover,
competition between RNA repair and decay regulates an important cellular
homeostasis pathway, suggesting that this mode of regulation of RNA fate
may be widespread. We are currently developing new methods for identifying
unhealed RNAs, and are applying this new collection of methods to identify
RNAs subject to healing, repair and decay.
