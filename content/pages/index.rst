**Greetings.** Welcome to the `Hesselberth lab
<http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Faculty/PrimaryFaculty/Pages/Hesselberth.aspx>`_
in the `Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics department
<http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/departments/biochemistry/Pages/Home.aspx>`_
at the `University of Colorado School of Medicine
<http://www.ucdenver.edu/anschutz/Pages/landing.aspx>`_. We develop
molecular methods to study DNA, RNA and proteins, and apply them to study
specific biological problems. We collaborate extensively with others
to apply these methods as broadly as possible.

mutation**.
We are developing genome-scale methods for studying how DNA modifications
lead to mutation. Our new `Excision-seq 
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015380>`_ and `Ribose-seq
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622106>`_
methods enable high resolution
mapping of DNA modification throughout the genome. We aim to use these
methods to dissect the mutational process, to understand how hot spots of
mutation form in the human genome. We are currently using Excision-seq to
study uracilcation of HIV genomes during infection, and mammalian DNA
demethylation. We are also extending the method to characterize other
types of DNA damage in genomes, including sugar and phosphate
modifications.

**RNA end modification and fate**. We have developed `methods
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075163>`_ to identify RNAs with
"dirty" ends that are generated by programmed or unintentional RNA
cleavage. We discovered that eukaryotic RNA end modification governs the fate of RNA
fragments, poising them for further processing or decay. Moreover,
competition between RNA repair and decay regulates an important cellular
homeostasis pathway, suggesting that this mode of regulation may be
widespread. We are currently developing new methods for identifying RNA
with specific end modifications, and are applying these new methods to
identify new RNA end modificaiton substrates, and to understand how these
modifications impact RNA fate.
