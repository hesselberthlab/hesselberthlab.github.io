# Lab Overview

My group focuses on understanding how and why cells repair their genetic material. We use genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology to study why cells repair RNA transcipts. We also develop next-generation technologies to analyze how cells catalyze DNA repair and how this ability to repair DNA changes in disease.

Our lab is in the [RNA Bioscience Initiative](http://rnabio.co) at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
