# Lab Overview

My group develops new methods to understand how cells repair their genetic material. We use genetics, biochemistry and cell biology to understand how and why cells repair RNA transcipts. We also develop next-generation technologies for understanding how cells catalyze DNA repair, and how their ability to repair DNA changes in disease.

Our lab is in the [RNA Bioscience Initiative](http:///rnabio.co) at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.
