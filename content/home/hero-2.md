Like DNA repair systems that surveil and repair genome damage to preserve the genetic code, the products of RNA damage are substrates for coupled end modification and processing steps. But unlike our deep under-standing of the DNA damage response, we are only beginning to learn how RNA damage, end modification, and processing are integrated in the RNA damage response to orchestrate RNA processing for regulatory control.
