I have developed two courses that teach computational approaches for genomics and data analysis:

- [MOLB 7621: Genome Analysis Workshop](http://molb7621.github.io/workshop)
- [IDPT 7801 006: Exploratory Biological Data Analysis in R and RStudio](https://ucdenver.instructure.com/courses/381582/assignments/syllabus)

I also teach a few lectures on molecular biology and bioinformatics in
these classes:

- HMGP 7620: Genomics
- IDPT 5002: Molecules to Medicine
