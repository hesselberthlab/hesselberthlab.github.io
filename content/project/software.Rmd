# valr <img src="valr-logo.png" align="right" />

**`valr` provides tools to read and manipulate genome intervals and signals**, similar to the [`BEDtools`][1] suite. [`valr`](http://rnabioco.github.io/valr/) enables analysis in the R/RStudio environment, leveraging modern R tools in the [`tidyverse`][4] for a terse, expressive syntax. Compute-intensive algorithms are implemented in [`Rcpp`][3]/C++, and many methods take advantage of the speed and grouping capability provided by [`dplyr`][2].
