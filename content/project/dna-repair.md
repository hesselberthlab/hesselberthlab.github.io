We develop methods to understand how DNA damage leads to mutation. We previously developed [Excision-seq](#excision-seq) and [Ribose-seq](#ribose-seq) to measure DNA nucleobase and sugar modification with single-nucleotide resolution.

## Single-cell analysis of DNA repair capacity

We are developing a new method that is able to measure DNA repair capacity in bulk and single-cell extracts. Will apply the method to understand how heterogeneity in DNA repair capacity contributes to resistance to cancer chemotherapy.

## Funding

This work is funded by a Research Scholar Grant from the American Cancer Society.
