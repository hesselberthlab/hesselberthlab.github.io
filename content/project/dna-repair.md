DNA repair is essential for cellular homeostasis and is a key mediator of cancer cell survival following genotoxic therapies. Because tumor evolution often remodels DNA repair capacity to counteract these therapies, there is significant interest in “precision medicine” approaches to determine whether a tumor will be responsive to a therapy prior to its delivery and to track the development of tumor resistance during therapy.

## Excision-seq

We previously developed [Excision-seq](/publication/2014/bryan) to study the genome-wide distribution of modified nucleobases in DNA. We have used Excision-seq to study the distribution of uracil and pyrimidine dimers in genomic DNA that accumulate under specific conditions. A related method called [XR-seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Sancar+A+AND+XR-seq) has been developed in Aziz Sancar's lab to study the distribution of pyrimidine dimers in genomic DNA.

## Ribose-seq 

We developed [Ribose-seq](/publication/2015/koh) in collaboration with [Francesca Storici's group](http://biosci.gatech.edu/people/francesca-storici) to study the distribution of embedded ribonucleotides in DNA.
