## Single-cell analysis of DNA repair capacity

We are developing a new method that is able to measure DNA repair capacity in bulk and single-cell extracts. Will apply the method to understand how heterogeneity in DNA repair capacity contributes to resistance to cancer chemotherapy.

## Excision-seq

We previously developed [Excision-seq](/publication/2014/bryan) to study the genome-wide distribution of modified nucleobases in DNA. 

## Ribose-seq 

We developed [Ribose-seq](#/publication/2015/koh) in collaboration with [Francesca Storici's group]() to study the distribution of embedded ribonucleotides in DNA.


## Funding

This work is funded by a Research Scholar Grant from the American Cancer Society and the Denver chapter of the [Golfers Against Cancer](/post/golfers-against-cancer).
