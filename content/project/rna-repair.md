We use genetics, biochemistry and cell biology to understand how and why cells repair RNA transcripts. 

## tRNA splicing

We exploited a previously developed strategy to bypass the essential function of RNA repair enzymes in budding yeast. Cells that express "pre-spliced" tRNAs are viable in the absence of the tRNA ligase and 2Â´-phosphotransferase. We are using these cells to understand tRNA processing and translational fidelity.

## Unfolded protein response

The unfolded protein reponse (UPR) is a conserved pathway that increases the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum during periods of protein folding stress. In budding yeast, the UPR is activated by the transmembrane kinase/endoribonucuelase Ire1, which liberates an intron from the *HAC1* pre-mRNA. Ligation of the exons leads to translation of the Hac1 transcription factor, which moves to the nucleus and upregulates hundreds of stress-reponse genes.

Using the RNA repair mutants, we uncovered new regulatory points during *HAC1* splicing in the unfolded protein response. 

## New substrates of RNA repair

We are conducting targeted and genome-wide searches for other targets of RNA repair. Such studies could provide new insights into the role of RNA repair in cellular physiology.

## Funding

This work is funded by an NIH MIRA grant (R35 GM119550).
