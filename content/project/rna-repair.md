## What is RNA repair?

RNA repair involves three sequential actvities:

1. Spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed RNA cleavage
2. Remodeling of new RNA termini by RNA end modifying enzymes.
3. Rejoining of the broken ends by an RNA ligase.


## tRNA splicing <img style="float: right;" src="/img/figure/trna-block.svg">

We exploited a previously developed strategy to bypass the essential function of RNA repair enzymes in budding yeast. Cells that express "pre-spliced" tRNAs are viable in the absence of the tRNA ligase and 2´-phosphotransferase. We are using these cells to understand tRNA processing and translational fidelity.

## Unfolded protein response  <img style="float: right;" src="/img/figure/upr.svg">

The unfolded protein reponse (UPR) is a conserved pathway that increases the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum during periods of protein folding stress. In budding yeast, the UPR is activated by the transmembrane kinase/endoribonucuelase Ire1, which liberates an intron from the *HAC1* pre-mRNA. Ligation of the exons leads to translation of the Hac1 transcription factor, which moves to the nucleus and upregulates hundreds of stress-reponse genes.

Using the RNA repair mutants, we uncovered new regulatory points during *HAC1* splicing in the unfolded protein response. 

## Remodeling and sensing of RNA termini


## New substrates of RNA repair

We are conducting targeted and genome-wide searches for other targets of RNA repair. Such studies could provide new insights into the role of RNA repair in cellular physiology.

## RNA-seq methods to study RNA repair

We previously developed methods to capture [2´,3´-cyclic phosphate](/publication/2010/Schutz) and [5´-OH](/publication/2015/Peach) products of RNA decay and have used these broadly to study spontaneous and enzyme-catalyzed RNA cleavage.
