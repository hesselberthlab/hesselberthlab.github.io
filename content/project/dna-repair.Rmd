We develop methods to understand how DNA damage leads to mutation. We previously developed [Excision-seq](#excision-seq) and [Ribose-seq](#ribose-seq) to measure DNA nucleobase and sugar modification with single-nucleotide resolution.

We are developing a new method called [Haircut](#haircut) that is able to measure DNA repair capacity in bulk and single-cell extracts.
