BEDTools Overview
=================

BEDTools will be one of the tools with the best return on investment. For
example, to extract out **all genes that overlap a CpG island**:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -u -a genes.hg19.bed.gz -b cpg.bed.gz \
                                     > genes-in-islands.bed

:ref:`intersect <bedtools:intersect>` is a bedtools tool. It follows a
common pattern in bedtools that the query file is specified after the
``-a`` flag and the *subject* file after the ``-b`` flag

BEDTools Utility
================

Finding all overlaps between a pair of BED files naively in python would look like:

.. code-block:: python

    for a in parse_bed('a.bed'):
        for b in parse_bed('b.bed'):
            if overlaps(a, b):
                # do stuff

If *'a.bed'* has 10K entries and *'b.bed'* has 100K entries, this would involved
checking for overlaps **1 billion times**. That will be slow.

BEDTools uses an indexing scheme that reduces the number of tests
dramatically.

.. note::
  
  See the original BEDTools paper for more information:
  http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/6/841.full

BEDTools Utility (2)
====================

 + Fast: faster than intersect code you will write
 + Terse: syntax is terse, but readable
 + Formats: handles BED, VCF and GFF formats (gzip'ed or not)
 + Special Cases: handles stranded-ness, 1-base overlaps, abutted intervals,
   etc. (likely to be bugs if you do code in manually)

BEDTools Commands
=================

To see all available BEDTools commands, type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools

The most commonly used BEDtools are:

    + :ref:`intersect <bedtools:intersect>`
    + :ref:`genomecov <bedtools:genomecov>`
    + :ref:`closest <bedtools:closest>`
    + :ref:`map <bedtools:map>`

BEDTools Documentation
======================

The BEDTools documentation is quite good and ever improving.

See the documentation for :ref:`intersect <bedtools:intersect>` with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect

The online HTML help is also good and includes pictures: 
 https://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html

BEDTools intersect
==================
Have a browser window open to :ref:`BEDTools intersect documentation <bedtools:intersect>`.
It will likely be the BEDTools function that you use the most. It has a lot of
options.

.. image:: http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/intersect-glyph.png

"-v" means (like grep) include all intervals from `-a` that do not overlap
intervals in `-b`

Example Files
=============

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat a.bed 
    chr1    10  20  a1  1   +
    chr1    100 200 a2  2   -

    $ cat b.bed 
    chr1    20  30  b1  1   +
    chr1    90  101 b2  2   -
    chr1    100 110 b3  3   +
    chr1    200 210 b4  4   +

What will happen if you intersect those files?
For example, the *a.bed* region `chr1:100-200` overlaps::

    chr1:90-101 
    chr1:100-110

from *b.bed*

intersect
=========

intersect with default arguments means **extract chunks of `-a` that overlap
regions in `-b`**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed
    chr1    100 101 a2  2   -
    chr1    100 110 a2  2   -

Here is the original interval from *a.bed*::

    chr1	100	200	a2	2	-

And the overlapping intervals from *b.bed*::

    chr1	90	101	b2	2	-
    chr1	100	110	b3	3	+

intersect -wa
=============

Often, we want the *entire interval from -a if it overlaps any interval in -b*

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -wa
    chr1    100 200 a2  2   -
    chr1    100 200 a2  2   -

We can get that uniquely with (-u)



intersect -wo
=============

We can see which intervals in *-b* are associated with *-a*

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -wo
    chr1  100  200  a2  2  -  chr1  90  101  b2  2  -  1
    chr1  100  200  a2  2  -  chr1  100  110  b3  3  +  10

intersect exercise
==================

What happens if you reverse the arguments? E.g. instead of::

  -a a.bed -b b.bed

use::

   -b a.bed -a b.bed

Try that with no extra flags, with -u, -wa, -wo.

How does it compare to the original?

intersect -c
============

We can count overlaps for each interval in *-a* with those in *-b* with

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -c
    chr1	10	20	a1	1	+	0
    chr1	100	200	a2	2	-	2

This is our original `a.bed` with an **additional column indicating number of
overlaps** with `b.bed`


intersect -v
============

Extract intervals in `a.bed` that do not overlap any interval in `b.bed`

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -v
    chr1	10	20	a1	1	+

Extract intervals in `b.bed` that do not overlap any interval in `a.bed`

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a b.bed -b a.bed -v
    chr1	20	30	b1	1	+
    chr1	200	210	b4	4	+

Intersect Summary
=================

 + fragments of `a` that overlap `b`:
    `intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed`
 + complete regions of `a` that overlap `b`:
    `intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -u`
 + intervals of `b` as well as `a`:
    `intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -wo`
 + number of times each `a` overlaps `b`:
    `intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -c`
 + intervals of `a` that do not overlap `b`:
    `intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -v`

Other Reading
=============

+ Check out the online `documentation <https://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html>`_.
+ A `tutorial <http://quinlanlab.org/tutorials/cshl2013/bedtools.html>`_ by the author of BEDTools

Intersect Bam
=============

We have seen that `intersect <bedtools:intersect>` takes `-a` and `-b`
arguments. It can also intersect against an alignment BAM file by using `-abam`
in place of `-a`

e.g:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect \
        -abam experiment.bam \
        -b target-regions.bed \
        > on-target.bam

Intersect Strand
================

From the `help <https://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html>`_ ,
one can see that intersect can consider strand. For example if both files have a
strand field then

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools intersect -a a.bed -b b.bed -s

Will only consider as overlapping those intervals in `a.bed` that have the same
strand as `b.bed`.

Closest
=======

with :ref:`intersect <bedtools:intersect>` we can only get overlapping
intervals. :ref:`closest <bedtools:closest>` reports the nearest interval even
if it's not overlapping. 

Example: report the nearest CpG to each gene as long as it is within 5KB.

.. code-block:: bash

    bedtools closest \
        -a genes.hg19.bed.gz \
        -b cpg.bed.gz -d \
        | awk '$NF <= 5000'

Map
===

For each CpG print the sum of the values (4th column) of overlapping intervals from
lamina.bed (and filter out those with no overlap using awk)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bedtools map \
        -a cpg.bed.gz \
        -b /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed \
        -c 4 -o sum \
        | awk '$5 != "."'

Other *-o* perations include **min**, **max**, **mean**, **median**, **concat**

Sorted
======

When you start dealing with larger data-files. Look at the `-sorted` flag.
For example in :ref:`intersect <bedtools:intersect>`.

 + Uses less memory
 + Faster

Takes advantage of sorted chromosome, positions in both files so it doesn't have
to create an index.

Genomecov
=========

Get coverage of intervals in BED by BAM 

.. image:: https://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/genomecov-glyph.png

Usually want the last option `-bg -split`
