Class 10 : Applied Python 
*************************

:Class date: Wednesday February 19

Install Toolshed
================

Confirm you have the toolshed module installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -c "import toolshed"

If you get an error, run this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install toolshed

If you still get an error, ask for help.

Goals
=====

 #. homework review
 #. example application

Homework Review
===============

 + Everyone is having trouble with :ref:`problem-set-3`.

 + Trouble integrating simple python constructs (dicts, lists, strings) and
   logic (if blocks, for loops) to perform some tasks.

 + Specific questions about homework?

 + Questions 1, 2.

 + `toolshed module <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toolshed>`_.

Application Impetus
===================

It is helpful to read python code that solves a common problem to
better understand how to use data-structures.

A python script that combines data from two files:

#. laboratory information on immune cell measurements.
#. information on a sequencing run for a subset of those samples.

This is real data (shuffled to protect innocent mice) and a real python script
(data from Ken Eyring and Ted Shade)

Data Files
==========

Download these files into "/opt/bio-workshop/data/"

**laboratory info:** :download:`sample-lab-info.tsv <../misc/data/sample-lab-info.tsv>`

**sequence info:** :download:`sample-seq-info.csv <../misc/data/sample-seq-info.csv>`

**merging script:** :download:`sample-merge.py <../../src/sample-merge.py>`

Once downloaded, look at the structure of the data files with `less`

We will spend this class *deriving*/*understanding* `sample-merge.py`

Set Up The Problem
==================

 + goal: merge the information from the 2 files.

 + we will add info from sample-seq-info.csv to sample-lab-info.tsv

 + sample-seq-info.csv contains a super-set of the samples in
   sample-lab-info.csv

 + we will match samples by the `Sample` column in sample-lab-info.tsv to
   the `Sample ID` column in sample-seq-info.csv

   * we will store rows from sample-seq-info.csv in a dictionary keyed by
     `Sample ID`

 + since we are **adding** to sample-lab-info.tsv, we don't need to filter
   out as we read from sample-seq-info.csv

Understand The Problem
======================

This is important!!

Any questions on file formats or our strategy?

Decide on Coding Strategy
=========================

#. read from `sample-seq-info.csv` into a dictionary with
   keys of `Sample ID` and values (dicts) with the data for that sample. We
   This dictionary is **seq_infos**. (skip header while fields[0] != "Lane")

#. loop (stream) over `sample-lab-info.tsv` to get **lab_info**
   for each sample

   #. Find matching *sequence-info* for each row by using the `Sample` column as a
      key into **seq_infos**

   #. The corresponding value of seq_infos[sample] will be all of the laboratory
      information for that sample.

   #. Add the *seq_info* for the current sample to the *lab_info* using: 
      `lab_info.update(seq_info)`

   #. print out the **lab_info** with newly added **seq_info**

Script
======

coming slides will go over the script block-by-block before viewing / 
running / modifying the entire script.

Script: Read seq info into dictionary
=====================================

.. code-block:: python

    # store data for all samples here, keys of sample-id, values of info
    seq_infos = {}

    # loop over each sample in seq_info
    for si in reader(seq_file, sep=",",
                     skip_while=is_extra_lines):
        sample_id = si['Sample ID']
        seq_infos[sample_id] = si

Now we have a dictionary with keys of sample ids and values of 
dictionaries containing the information for each sample.

We will use this as a lookup-table so that, given a sample_id from the
**lab_info** we can find the associated **seq_info**

Script: Iterate over lab-info and add seq-info
==============================================

We skip some error checking steps here for simplicity

.. code-block:: python

    is_first_line = True

    for lab_info in reader(lab_file):
        sample_id = lab_info['Sample']

        # we will add more logic here in the real script.
        seq_info = seq_infos[sample_id]
        lab_info.update(seq_info)
        # now lab_info has the sequene and the lab keys and values.

        if is_first_line: # print a header once only.
            print "\t".join(lab_info.keys())
            is_first_line = False

        # this will print out the data for each record.
        print "\t".join(lab_info.values())

Script: Run
===========

Let's run the script and see what comes out

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example-merge.py > merged.tsv

look at merged info with `less` and verify that it has columns from
sample-lab-info.csv and sample-seq-info.csv


Script: Gedit
=============

Now let's open the script in gedit and go through it line-by-line!!

Script: Debug
=============

We can run the script from **ipython** as

.. ipython:: 

    In [1]: %run sample-merge.py

Open a gedit window and add some print statements to the script, followed by
"1/0" so that the script will stop and you can see what was printed. Save, then
run from ipython window.

This is a quick way to follow the flow of a script. As you understand each part,
move the print statement and the 1/0 further on in the script.
 
Spend the rest of class breaking, fixing and understanding this script.
