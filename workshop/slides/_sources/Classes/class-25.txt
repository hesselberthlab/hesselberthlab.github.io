Class 25 : Exome-Seq - Alignment
********************************

Goals
=====

 #. Not kill Tesla
 #. Exome Sequencing
 #. Alignment
 #. QC Alignments

Exome Sequencing
================

 + captures coding regions of genome
 + deeper coverage and more samples at same cost 
 + goal is to call variants (SNPs/deletions/insertions)
 + higher concentration of interesting variants
   relative to non-coding genome

Project Design
==============
 
.. image:: ../_static/images/phenotype.png


Project Design II
=================

8 sequenced samples from single family

 + paired-end 100 base reads
 + 5 affected
 + 3 unaffected

Analysis
========

 + How likely are we to find something?

 + Naive probability that 5 individuals have a variant and 3 do not (without
   considering pedigree)?

 + What if we find 1 million SNPs total?

 + How can we filter?

Alignment
=========

    + bwa mem to align the reads. 
    
    + bwa mem very good aligner for long reads

BWA mem
=======

Mark Duplicates
===============

Marking/removing duplicates is to remove the influence of PCR duplication on
variant calling.

 + Marking/Removing duplicates makes sense unless you have extremely deep coverage,
   especially on paired-end reads.

 + Uses position of both reads of a pair to determine duplication--if many pairs
   have the same start and sequence, all but 1 pair is marked as a duplicate.

 + Recommended by the variant caller that we will use.

 + To mark or not to mark? http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6854

Read Groups
===========

Your alignments should have read-groups.

These tell downstream tools what library and sample your data came from

Used for calling duplicates (repeats must be from same library)

With read-groups, can have multiple samples in a single BAM.


Variant Calling
===============

At each site in the genome, given:

 + base calls
 + base qualities
 + mapping qualities
 + surrounding sequence
 + position in read
 + strand bias
 + all of the above for other samples

What is the genotype of each sample and the confidence in that genotype?

Variant Calling Software
========================

The most commonly used software for variant calling is GATK:
Genome Analysis Toolkit

It has a number of steps including base recalibration, indel realignment,
etc.

We will use `freebayes` which has been shown to perform as well/better
(and it is much easier to use): https://github.com/ekg/freebayes

Freebayes
=========

https://github.com/ekg/freebayes

*FreeBayes is haplotype-based, in the sense that it calls variants based on the
literal sequences of reads aligned to a particular target, not their precise
alignment.*

*FreeBayes uses short-read alignments (BAM files) for any number of individuals
from a population and a reference genome to determine the most-likely combination
of genotypes for the population at each position in the reference. It reports
positions which it finds putatively polymorphic in variant call file (VCF) format.*


VCF Format
==========

File format for SNP/indel calls:

::

    CHROM      1
    POS        2345544
    ID         rs1234..
    REF        C
    ALT        TA
    QUAL       55.2

    FORMAT     GT:GQ:DP:HQ
    sample_1   0|0:48:1:51,51

    sample_n

":" delimited chunks from samples match the format in `FORMAT`
