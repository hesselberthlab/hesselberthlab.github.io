  Class 15 : ChIP-seq / DNase I
*********************************

:Class date: 2014 Mar 3 Monday

Final Project
=============

We will have a final project that is worth 15% of your grade, due on April
2.

We want you to come up with a question you can address with the tools you
learned in the class. You should incorporate ENCODE data into your
analysis, and you can also integrate your own data.

We will go over some analysis vignettes on Wed and Fri to illustrate
example final projects.

Goals
=====

 #. Connect UCSC browser to bigWig / bigBed files

 #. Compare ChIP and DNase I data

Coverage plots for ChIP and DNase I
===================================

You will want to calculate coverage plots that are appropriate for the
type of experiment. For example, in a ChIP experiment, you want to examine
the entire region covered by sequences.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ common_args="-ibam <aln.bam> -g <chrom.size> -bg"
    $ bedtools genomecov $common_args > coverage.bg

But in a DNase I mapping experiment, you only want to know the exact
position where DNase I cut the DNA, i.e. the 5' position. Use the ``-5``
flag in bedtools to only count 5' positions.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ common_args="-ibam <aln.bam> -g <chrom.size> -bg"
    $ bedtools genomecov $common_args -5 > coverage.5p.bg


ChIP-seq / DNase I data 
=======================

Compare ChIP-seq and DNase I data in browser [#]_.

Plot coverage with the Genome Browser
-------------------------------------

Use the UCSC Genome Browser to plot your data. Files in bedGraph format
can be large, so UCSC created a facility for posting binary format data in
a web-accessible directory that the browser can read.

.. code-block:: bash

    # NOTE: bedGraph and BED files must be sorted first

    # convert bedGraph to binary format (bigWig) 
    $ bedGraphToBigWig <coverage.bg> <chrom.sizes> <coverage.bw> 

    # convert BED to binary format (bigBed)
    $ bedToBigBed <peaks.bed> <chrom.sizes> <peaks.bb>

Posting your data
-----------------

We need to set up your accounts so that you will be able to see data
posted in your account. When this is setup, you should be able to put
files in::

    $HOME/public_html/file.html

and be able to see them like::

    http://amc-sandbox.ucdenver.edu/~username/file.html

Writing tracklines
------------------

You can now write "tracklines" [#]_ to tell where UCSC to find your data::

    # URL = http://amc-sandbox.ucdenver.edu/~username/path-to-binaryfile
    track type=bigWig bigDataUrl=<URL> name='coverage' color=r,g,b
    track type=bigBed bigDataUrl=<URL> name='peaks' color=r,g,b

.. [#] UCSC Track configuration

.. tip::

    Don't pick colors yourself, they will be ugly. **Use Colorbrewer**
    http://colorbrewer2.org.
    
    RGB colors in the ``Dark2`` and ``Set1`` qualitative palettes work
    well for UCSC display.

There are a large number of additional options you can use in tracklines
to change their display.

Problem Set Questions
=====================

Anybody have questions on the problem set?
