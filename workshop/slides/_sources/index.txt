Genome Informatics Workshop 
***************************

:Next offered: Spring 2015
:Course Number: MOLB 7620

**The Genome Informatics Workshop is a hands-on tutorial of skills needed to
process large genomics data sets and visualize their results. The class
is taught from the standpoint of biologist with practical goals
(e.g. to interpret the results of a sequencing-based experiment and gain
biologically meaningful insight).**

We focus on working in the Linux environment, with emphasis on Linux
command-line tools, Python programming and the R statistical computing
environment. We use publicly available next-generation DNA sequencing data
from the ENCODE project to illustrate standard approaches for manipulating
sequencing data, aligning sequences to a reference genome, generating
coverage plots and displaying them in the UCSC Genome Browser. We will
cover specific analyses used in ENCODE project including ChIP-seq, DNase I
footprinting, mRNA-seq and genome sequencing to identify single nucleotide
and structural variants.
