Course Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**The Genome Informatics Workshop is a hands-on tutorial of skills needed
to process large genomics data sets and visualize their results. The class
is taught from the standpoint of a biologist with practical goals (e.g. to
interpret the results of a sequencing-based experiment and gain
biologically meaningful insight).**

We focus on working in the Linux environment, with emphasis on
command-line tools, Python programming and the R statistical computing
environment. We use publicly available next-generation DNA sequencing data
from the ENCODE project to illustrate standard approaches for manipulating
sequencing data, aligning sequences to a reference genome, generating
coverage plots and displaying them in the UCSC Genome Browser. We will
cover specific analyses used in ENCODE project including ChIP-seq, DNase I
footprinting, mRNA-seq and genome sequencing to identify single nucleotide
and structural variants.
