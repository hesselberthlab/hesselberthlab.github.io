Class Overview
==============
Each class is 90 minutes. We intend to spend the first 30 min going
through exercises that demonstrate how specific tools are useful in
bioinformatics. During the remaining hour, we expect you to work through
exercises, asking for help when you get stuck. 

We will record the first 30 minutes using Panopto Screen Capture, and
these recordings will be available in Canvas. We have found that simply
watching someone work in a terminal (move around, open up text editors,
write and execute simple programs) can be a very effective way to get
started with programming. Hopefully these movies will serve the same
purpose.

Each week, we will have 1 take home quiz, due the following Tuesday at 5
PM. 

The Virtual Machine (VM)
========================
The VM will let you run Linux on your laptop, or the laptops available at
the Teaching Lab. The VM has many of the tools you will need for analysis
pre-installed. Feel free to install other tools that you think will be
useful.

To install the VM:

 #. Download VirtualBox from virtualbox.org

 #. Open VirtualBox. Click "New" in the upper left corner.

 #. In the "Name" field, type bio-workshop.  For "Type" select Linux.  For
    "Version"  select Ubuntu.  Click continue.

 #. Allocate an amount of memory that keeps the bar in the green zone.
    2048MB is a nice number.  Click continue.

 #. Click the "Use an existing virtual hard drive file" radio button.
    Click the folder icon.  Select the .vdi file provided on your USB stick.

 #. Click create.

 #. Press the "Start" button.

Important Directories
=====================
You will learn about directories in the next class, but note that the
content for this class is available in:

.. code-block:: bash

    /opt/bio-workshop/

When you write answers to your homeworks, they should be runnable from
a directory like:

.. code-block:: bash

   /opt/bio-workshop/homeworks/section_1/week1/

Terminal and Gedit
==================
When you open a Terminal, you also launch a shell process, typically a
bash process. At the prompt, you can type things that bash understands,
and it will do them. The shell has its own language, which you will learn
over the course of the class. It also runs executable files that it can
find on the PATH (i.e. the set of directories that contain exectuables).

You can find what is on your PATH by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ echo $PATH

The PATH is one of several environment variables that are created when you
login. You can see all of these with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ env

.. nextslide::
    :increment:

One important program in the PATH is gedit. You will use this program to
keep notes and write small programs. There are other editors (e.g. vim and
emacs) that have additional features; it's up to you whether you would
like to learn those or stick with the graphical gedit.

To run gedit, use:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gedit

This will open a window where you can type. You can write a small test
document and save it.

Shell and Python Programming
============================
It is important that you learn a few new computer languages. Others have
developed very good guides to teach you these languages, and we are going
to use those in the class. We expect you to begin taking these classes
immediately, doing them within the VM for practice.

You will spend a lot of time going through these online classes, both in
schedule class time, and outside of class time. Instead of focusing on
teaching you these languages, we will focus on helping you get through all
of the frustating problems that come up when you're learning the languages.

We will spend the first ~2 weeks learning shell [#]_ and all the things
you have access to within the shell.

After learning shell, we will begin learning Python [#]_. The Python
language allows you to do more sophisticated things that would be possible
in shell, but would be considerably more clunky.

First Quiz : Reading
====================
Computational biology projects inevitably accrue a lot of files. For the
first quiz, you'll need to read a paper [#]_ and be able to put a set of
files in the correct places. We highly recommend adopting this scheme for
all of your projects in and out of the class.
