******************************************

:Class date: Wednesday 5 February 2014

Goals
=====
#. Grep overview
#. Login to cluster
#. Learn about cluster-specific commands
#. Queueing system basics

grep
====
Use :linuxman:`grep(1)` to identify lines in a file that match a specified pattern.

To find any instance of *chr5* in the lamina.bed file

.. code-block:: bash

    # grep [pattern] [filename]
    $ grep chr5 /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed | head

To find all lines that start with a number sign:

.. code-block:: bash

    # The caret (^) matches the beginning of the line
    # FYI dollar sign ($) matches the end
    $ grep '^#' /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed

.. nextslide::
    :increment:

To find any line that *does not* start with "chr":

.. code-block:: bash

    # the -v flag inverts the match (grep "not" [pattern])
    $ grep -v '^chr' /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed

Beware of using ``grep`` to find patterns that might be partial matches:

.. code-block:: bash

    # this will match chr1, chr10, chr11 etc.
    $ grep chr1 /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed | cut -f1 | uniq

You can find exact matches that are split on words with the ``-w`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

    # this will only match chr1
    $ grep -w chr1 /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed | cut -f1 | uniq

.. nextslide::
    :increment:

Beware of using ``grep`` to search for numbers:

.. code-block:: bash

    # finds all strings that match `100`
    $ grep 100 /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed | head -n 20

    # better, but doesn't look at numeric value
    $ grep -w 100 /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed | head -n 20

.. tip::

    If you're trying to find numeric values in a file, use ``awk``
    instead::

        $ awk '$2 == 500' /opt/bio-workshop/data/lamina.bed

Cluster access
==============
We have set up accounts for the class on our departmental cluster. We will
set up your accounts at the end of class and reset your passwords:

.. code-block:: bash

    # the -X flag starts an X11 connection 
    $ ssh -X username@amc-tesla.ucdenver.pvt

    ...

    # once you are logged in, text your X11 connection with
    $ xeyes

Cluster etiquette
=================
There are some specific rules you need to know when you're operating in a
cluster environment.

.. graphviz::

    digraph cluster {
        "YOU" [shape=box];
        "amc-tesla" [shape=box];
        "filesystem" [shape=box];
        "compute nodes" [shape=box];
        "YOU" -> "amc-tesla";
        "amc-tesla" -> "filesystem";
        "amc-tesla" -> "compute nodes";
    }

.. important::

  **DO NOT** run jobs on the head node (amc-tesla). The head node is the
  brains of the cluster and it can easily be overextended. Use ``qlogin``
  instead.

Example commands on the cluster
===============================
Find the size of the file system:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ df -h

Find how much space you have allocated:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ quota -h

The queueing system
===================
First you will grab a single CPU from the queueing system so that you can
work without affecting the head node. We use ``qlogin`` for this:

.. code-block:: bash

    jhessel@amc-tesla ~
    $ qlogin 

    Job <492536> is submitted to queue <interactive>.
    <<ssh X11 forwarding job>>
    <<Waiting for dispatch ...>>
    <<Starting on compute00>>

    jhessel@compute00 ~
    $ 

.. note:: 

    The host in the prompt changed from ``amc-tesla`` to ``compute00``.
    
You can now execute long-running processes without worry of affecting the
cluster. Type ``exit`` to return back to your head node login.

The queueing system (2)
=======================
The cluster uses a queueing system that will run jobs that you submit to
it. You can write a small test script to see how the system works. First,
write this into a run.sh file:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    #BSUB -J sleeper
    #BSUB -e %J.err
    #BSUB -o %J.out

    sleep 20

The queueing system (3)
=======================
The ``#BSUB`` lines are comments, but are read by the ``bsub`` program to
identify features associated with your job. 

    - ``-J`` sets the job's name
    - ``%J`` is a unique job ID that is set when you run the job.
    - ``-e`` and ``-o`` set the filenames for stderr and stdout from the job

The queueing system (4)
=======================
Now you can submit the script to the queuing system. As soon as you submit
it, you can check on its progress:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bsub < run.sh
    $ bjobs

After the job finishes, you should see two new files that end
`.out` and `.err`; these stdout and stderr from the running job.
Look at the contents of those files so you know what is in
each one.

Killing jobs
============
Sometimes you need to kill your jobs. You can kill specific jobs using
their job ID numbers, obtained from checking ``bjobs``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bkill <jobid> 

You can also kill **all** of your jobs at once:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bkill 0 

.. warning::

    ``bkill 0`` is dangerous â€“ it will wipe out all of your jobs. If
    you have long-running jobs that you forgot about, you will kill them
    too if you are not careful!

Other cluster-specific commands
===============================
.. code-block:: bash

    $ bhosts     # hosts in the cluster
    $ man bhosts # bsub man page
    $ bqueues    # available queues
    $ lsload     # check load values for all hosts

In Class Exercises
==================
We're going to take a break this class so that you can catch up on your
exercises. Please spend some time going back through the exercises from
classes 1-4.
