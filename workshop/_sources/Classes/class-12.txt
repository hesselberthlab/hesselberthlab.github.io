Class 12 : The ENCODE Project

:Class date: Monday February 24

Problem Set Submission
======================

See the whiteboard.

Python Debugging
================
Many people are struggling with simple debugging issues. Stratgies:

Use :py:func:`print` copiously. For example, Print out a nested
data structure as it is being created

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 10

    from collections import defaultdict

    nested = defaultdict(list)

    for chrom, start, end in parse_bed(bedfile):

        coords = (start, end)
        nested[chrom].append(coords)

        print nested

.. nextslide::
    :increment:

Use the Python Debugger: :py:mod:`pdb`.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 1,5

    import pdb

    for idx in range(100):
        ...
        pdb.set_trace()

    # keys:
    # c(ontinue) : move through the current context (i.e. loop)
    # <ctrl>-c   : exit the debugger
    (Pdb) idx
    0
    (Pdb) c
    (Pdb) idx
    1

Goals
=====

 #. What is the ENCODE project?
 
 #. What kinds of data did the ENCODE project produce? 
 
 #. Where can I find these data on the Internet? 
 
ENCODE Project Timeline: 2003
=============================
 
The Human Genome Project was finished, giving us a list of human genes and their 
locations. Unfortunately, we still had no idea how they were regulated. If only 
there was an `ENCyclopedia Of Dna Elements 
<http://www.sciencemag.org.hsl-ezproxy.ucdenver.edu/content/306/5696/636.full>`_…

Advantages: massive amounts of information on key cell lines, reproducible 
experiments, public data access, technology development.

ENCODE Project Cell Lines
=========================

Tier 1: GM12878 (EBV-transformed lymphoblast), K562 (CML lymphoblast), H1-hESC

Tier 2: HeLa-S3 (cervical cancer), HepG2 (liver carcinoma), HUVEC (umbilical vein)

Tier 2.5: SKNSH (neuroblastoma), IMR90 (lung fibroblast), A549 (lung carcinoma), 
MCF7 (breast carcinoma), LHCN (myoblast), CD14+, CD20+

links to cell culture protocols)

Experiments
===========

#. ChIP-seq: Histone marks, transcription factors

#. Chromatin structure: DNaseI-seq, FAIRE, 5C/Hi-C

#. RNA expression: mRNA-seq, GENCODE gene predictions

#. Data Integration: Segway / ChromHMM integration of functional data


Common File Formats
===================

#. FASTQ: You've already seen this; it's raw sequencing data.

#. BAM/SAM: Aligned sequence data

#. Bed/bigBed: List of genomic regions

#. Bedgraph/Wig/bigWig: Continuous signal (e.g. methylation mapping)


ENCODE Project Timeline: 2007
==============================

Completion of `pilot project <http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/encode.hg18.html>`_ 
(1% of the human genome). 
(`summary paper with list of analyses in Table 1: 
<http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7146/full/nature05874.html>`_)

GENCODE
=======

ENCODE identifies functional genomic elements; `GENCODE <http://www.gencodegenes.org>`_ 
is the annotation of those elements based on ENCODE data. This will ideally be the 
most comprehensive reference gene set once the project is complete. 

ENCODE Project Timeline: 2012
=============================

Completion of the entire project, and a ton of papers: 
`Nature <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/index.html>`_, 
`Genome Research <http://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/9.toc>`_, 
`Genome Biology <http://genomebiology.com/content/13/9>`_, 
`paper viewer that is also an iPad app <http://www.nature.com/encode/#/threads>`_, 
and the `front page of the New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/science/far-from-junk-dna-dark-matter-proves-crucial-to-health.html?pagewanted=all>`_
