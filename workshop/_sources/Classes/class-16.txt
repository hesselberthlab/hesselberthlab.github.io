Class 16: Genomic Analysis Vignettes 
************************************

:Class date: 2014 Mar 5 Wednesday

Vignettes
=========
We will go over workflows for a few specific genomic analyses. Your final
projects should be of similar scope and complexity.

:Hypothesis: Cell-type-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites are less
             evolutionarily conserved than constitutive hypersensitve sites

#. Determine how similar patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity are across all
   mapped human cell types.

#. Calculate mean conservation scores for the matrix of cell types.

#. Correlate patterns of DHS sensititvity and conservation.
